\title{Calculate Correlation of Paired Expression (CoPE)}
\usage{
calculate_cope(milos, dt_match, genes = NULL, method = "spearman")
}
\arguments{
\item{milos}{List of 2 Milo objects with a filled nhoodExpression slot.}

\item{dt_match}{A data.table with 2 columns containing the nhood-nhood matching.
The first column contains neighbourhood names from the 1st Milo object,
the second column contains neighbourhood names from the 2nd Milo object.}

\item{genes}{A character vector of gene names for which to calculate the CoPE score.
Genes must be present in both Milo objects' rownames.
If \code{NULL}, uses all available genes.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the correlation method.
Must be one of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"}, or \code{"spearman"}.
Default is \code{"spearman"}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with 2 columns:
  \item{gene}{Gene name.}
  \item{cope}{Correlation of paired expression score.}
}
\description{
Calculates the correlation of gene expression values between pairs of matched neighbourhoods
to identify conserved genes across datasets.
}
\examples{
# Not run: calculate_cope(milos, dt_match, genes = c("gene1", "gene2"))
}
