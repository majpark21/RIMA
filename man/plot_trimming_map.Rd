\title{Heatmap: Visualize Edges Trimmed by Significance Testing}
\usage{
plot_trimming_map(
  milos,
  dt_sims_withSignif,
  cols_label = c("celltype", "celltype"),
  cluster_rows = TRUE,
  cluster_cols = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{milos}{A list of 2 Milo objects.}

\item{dt_sims_withSignif}{A data.table with at least 3 columns. Each row represents a pair
of neighbourhoods across the two Milos (first two columns contain neighbourhood identifiers).
Must include a logical column named \code{"is_significant"}.}

\item{cols_label}{Character vector of length 2 specifying column names from the Milo's
\code{colData}. Neighbourhoods will be annotated according to these columns and the
ratio of retained edges will be calculated between annotated groups.}

\item{cluster_rows}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, reorders rows using hierarchical clustering.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cluster_cols}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, reorders columns using hierarchical clustering.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying a heatmap with the fraction of retained edges.
}
\description{
Displays a heatmap showing the proportion of neighbourhood-neighbourhood edges retained
after significance filtering. Neighbourhoods are annotated and aggregated, showing how
many edges linking annotation groups passed significance thresholds.
