\title{Calculate Neighbourhood-Neighbourhood Similarities}
\usage{
calculate_similarities(milos, method = "spearman")
}
\arguments{
\item{milos}{List of 2 Milo objects with a filled nhoodExpression slot,
or alternatively a list of 2 matrices representing neighbourhood expression.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the similarity metric.
Must be one of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"}, or \code{"spearman"}.
Default is \code{"spearman"}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with 3 columns:
  \item{nhoods1}{Neighbourhood name from the 1st Milo object.}
  \item{nhoods2}{Neighbourhood name from the 2nd Milo object.}
  \item{sim}{Similarity value between the pair of neighbourhoods.}
}
\description{
Calculates pairwise similarity scores between neighbourhoods across two datasets
based on their expression profiles.
