\title{Heatmap: Visualize Neighbourhood Matches by Annotation}
\usage{
plot_matches_map(
  milos,
  dt_match,
  cols_label = c("celltype", "celltype"),
  cluster_rows = TRUE,
  cluster_cols = TRUE,
  transform = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{milos}{A list of 2 Milo objects.}

\item{dt_match}{A data.table with at least 3 columns. Each row represents a matched pair
of neighbourhoods across the two Milos (first two columns contain neighbourhood identifiers).}

\item{cols_label}{Character vector of length 2 specifying column names from the Milo's
\code{colData}. Neighbourhoods will be annotated according to these columns and the
number of matches will be calculated between the annotated groups.}

\item{cluster_rows}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, reorders rows using hierarchical clustering.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cluster_cols}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, reorders columns using hierarchical clustering.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{transform}{Character string or \code{NULL}. Specifies a transformation to apply to
match counts for visualization. Valid values include \code{"log10"}, \code{"log1p"}, \code{"sqrt"}.
See \code{?ggplot2::scale_fill_continuous} for more options. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying a heatmap of neighbourhood match counts.
}
\description{
Displays a heatmap showing which neighbourhoods were matched together, aggregated by
their annotations. Neighbourhoods are annotated with \code{annotate_nhoods()}, and
the number of matches between annotation labels is counted and displayed.
